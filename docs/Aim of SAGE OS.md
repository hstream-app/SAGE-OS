# Aim of SAGE OS

## 🌱 Project Title: SAGE OS (Self-Aware General Environment)

### 🧠 Vision

To create the world’s first truly **AI-integrated, self-evolving bare-metal operating system** that can run efficiently on low-power devices like the Raspberry Pi, and later be extended to other architectures such as x86 and RISC-V. SAGE OS seeks to bridge the gap between **operating systems**, **machine intelligence**, and **adaptive autonomy**.

---

## 🎯 Primary Objectives

1. **Build a Minimal, Bootable Bare-Metal OS**

   * Develop from scratch using Assembly and C.
   * Loadable and testable on Raspberry Pi 4 (and others).

2. **Integrate Lightweight AI/ML Components**

   * Use onboard data and pattern recognition to inform system behavior.
   * Optimize processes like scheduling, memory management, and I/O routing.

3. **Create an Adaptive Command-Line Interface**

   * Shell that evolves based on user behavior.
   * Suggests, completes, or modifies commands over time.

4. **Implement Self-Monitoring and Evolution**

   * Enable runtime analysis and behavior evolution.
   * Allow kernel-level self-updating or module evolution based on use-cases.

5. **Maintain a Low Memory Footprint and Fast Boot Time**

   * Core system to boot in <5 seconds.
   * Operate under 128MB RAM initially.

6. **Design for Security and Ethics**

   * Define constraints and transparency for autonomous behavior.
   * Ensure privacy and verifiable update integrity.

---

## 🌐 Broader Impact

* Explore the frontier where **operating systems and AI converge**.
* Contribute to open-source AI/OS research.
* Inspire future designs of **self-managing**, **adaptive**, and **autonomous systems**.

SAGE OS is not just about functionality. It's a philosophical and technical endeavor to **redefine what an OS can become** in the age of intelligent machines.
