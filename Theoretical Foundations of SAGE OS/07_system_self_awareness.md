### Theory: System-Level Self-Awareness

**Description:**
This theory postulates that a computing system can become "self-aware" — aware of its components, state, limitations, and actions — and use this awareness to make independent choices about self-preservation, optimization, or even purpose.

### Vision Statement:

To evolve an operating system capable of maintaining a model of itself, its environment, and interactions, and using this to make proactive, reflective, or emergent decisions.

### Scientific/Technical Basis:

* Meta-cognition in artificial intelligence
* System introspection and monitoring tools
* Embodied cognition in robotic systems
* Recursive self-modeling architectures

### Feasibility Commentary:

* Self-monitoring is standard in advanced systems
* True self-awareness is an open question in AI and cognitive science

### Relevance to SAGE OS:

* Positions the OS not just as a tool, but as a reflective entity
* Enables deeper integration of feedback loops and adaptive control

### Risks and Unknowns:

* Ethical questions about autonomy and control
* Potential for unanticipated behavior from self-directed action
* Requires strict safeguards and oversight
