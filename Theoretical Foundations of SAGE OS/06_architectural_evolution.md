### Theory: AI-Driven Architectural Evolution

**Description:**
The system evolves not just software but also hardware interaction models, instruction sets, and architectural layers. This includes reprogramming how system components talk, collaborate, and are structured internally.

### Vision Statement:

To enable an OS that adapts its architecture over time — adding, removing, or redesigning system abstractions (e.g., threads, memory regions, IO handlers) in response to its tasks, environment, or discoveries.

### Scientific/Technical Basis:

* Just-In-Time (JIT) architecture building
* Compiler and VM adaptation
* Instruction set synthesis and optimization
* Co-design paradigms in AI hardware/software synergy

### Feasibility Commentary:

* Dynamic microkernel and container systems show early forms of modularity
* Full rearchitecting remains highly experimental

### Relevance to SAGE OS:

* Offers long-term adaptability
* Breaks rigid OS paradigms and allows emergence of new computing forms

### Risks and Unknowns:

* Backward compatibility and standardization issues
* Difficult debugging and assurance of correctness
* Hardware coupling limits flexibility
