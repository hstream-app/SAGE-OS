### Theory: Self-Evolving Operating System

**Description:**
A self-evolving operating system is capable of modifying, patching, and improving its own components — kernel, shell, drivers, protocols — without external input or updates from human developers. This involves autonomous learning and adaptation based on runtime feedback, usage patterns, and performance goals.

### Vision Statement:

To create an OS that can learn from its own behavior, evolve to optimize itself continuously, and autonomously fix or reconfigure its structure to adapt to changing hardware, tasks, and environments.

### Scientific/Technical Basis:

* Reinforcement learning and continual learning algorithms
* Genetic programming for evolving code
* Self-hosted compiler toolchains and bootstrapping
* Introspective system design (e.g., self-debugging, kernel tracing)

### Feasibility Commentary:

* Partial components are possible today (e.g., A/B system updates, error recovery, dynamic patching)
* Full autonomy without human intervention remains a significant challenge in software reliability and safety

### Relevance to SAGE OS:

* Core to the identity of SAGE OS as an intelligent system
* Drives modular, introspective kernel architecture and AI-assisted tooling

### Risks and Unknowns:

* Potential for unintended system behavior or corruption
* Difficulty in maintaining trust, traceability, and verifiability of changes
* Requires secure rollback and sandboxing systems
