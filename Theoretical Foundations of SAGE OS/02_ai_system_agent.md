### Theory: AI as a System-Level Agent

**Description:**
AI is embedded within the core of the operating system as an active participant in system-level decision making. Rather than being a user-space application, AI routines influence task scheduling, memory allocation, hardware control, and resource prioritization.

### Vision Statement:

To position AI as a native subsystem that collaborates with or replaces traditional components like process managers, schedulers, and service controllers for more intelligent, adaptive behavior.

### Scientific/Technical Basis:

* Integration of AI models into low-level system code (C/Assembly bindings)
* Use of predictive models to anticipate system bottlenecks and preemptively adapt
* Symbolic and reinforcement-based agents managing system tasks

### Feasibility Commentary:

* Limited integration is feasible (AI-assisted schedulers, smart prefetching)
* Full replacement of traditional modules needs AI with high safety and correctness standards

### Relevance to SAGE OS:

* Embeds learning into the OS loop
* Provides autonomy and emergent behavior in how the system reacts to unknowns

### Risks and Unknowns:

* Hard real-time constraints might conflict with AI model latency
* Incorrect decisions by AI could destabilize the OS
* Need for continuous monitoring and fallback logic
