# SAGE OS Prototype

This prototype demonstrates a future-proof implementation of SAGE OS core components using the recommended technology stack from the CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines, with special support for Raspberry Pi 5 and AI HAT+ accelerator.

## Overview

This prototype implements:

1. A Rust-based kernel core with C FFI for hardware interaction
2. A simple AI inference engine using TensorFlow Lite Micro with AI HAT+ support (up to 26 TOPS)
3. A hardware abstraction layer (HAL) for cross-platform support, including Raspberry Pi 5
4. Secure communication using modern cryptography
5. Interactive shell with command processing
6. Memory management with allocation/deallocation capabilities

## Raspberry Pi 5 Support

SAGE OS includes specific support for Raspberry Pi 5 hardware:
- Updated peripheral addresses for RPi5
- Optimized performance for the new CPU
- Support for PCIe and other RPi5-specific features
- Configuration file optimized for RPi5 (`config_rpi5.txt`)

## AI HAT+ Integration

The AI HAT+ accelerator with up to 26 TOPS of neural processing power is fully supported:
- Dedicated driver for communication with the AI HAT+
- High-level Rust API for AI model loading and inference
- Power management for the AI accelerator
- Temperature monitoring
- Support for various model types and precisions

## Technology Stack

- **Languages**: Rust + C
- **Build System**: Cargo + CMake
- **AI Framework**: TensorFlow Lite Micro + AI HAT+ API
- **Cryptography**: libsodium/RustCrypto
- **Cross-compilation**: LLVM/Clang

## Getting Started

See the [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) file for instructions on building and running the prototype.

### Quick Start for Raspberry Pi 5

1. Build the kernel:
   ```bash
   make TARGET_PLATFORM=rpi5 ENABLE_AI=ON
   ```

2. Copy files to SD card:
   ```bash
   cp build/kernel8.img /path/to/sdcard/
   cp config_rpi5.txt /path/to/sdcard/config.txt
   ```

3. Insert SD card into Raspberry Pi 5 and power on

### Testing with QEMU

For testing without hardware:
```bash
./run_qemu.sh
```
