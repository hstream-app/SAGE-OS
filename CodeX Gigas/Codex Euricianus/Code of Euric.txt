# Codex Gigas
## Code of of Euric


Role of the Codex Euricianus in SAGE-OS
The Codex Euricianus can be envisioned as the central AI-driven component of SAGE-OS, responsible for its self-evolving, adaptive, and secure capabilities. Here’s how it fits into the system:

AI Engine: The Codex uses lightweight AI frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow Lite Micro) to analyze telemetry data, optimize performance, and generate drivers or patches.
Self-Evolution: It employs reinforcement learning and code generation (via LLVM) to autonomously update SAGE-OS, fixing bugs or adapting to new hardware.
Security Core: Encrypted with your iris fingerprint, the Codex ensures secure boot, code signing, and access control, protecting the OS from unauthorized changes.
Integration: It acts as the bridge between the Rust-based microkernel, hardware abstraction layer, and user interfaces, coordinating all autonomous operations.
