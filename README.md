# SAGE OS 🌱🧠
**Self-Aware General Environment**  
An experimental, bare-metal operating system designed from scratch to learn, adapt, and evolve — starting on Raspberry Pi.

---
 
  ## 🔭 Vision 

**SAGE OS** is not just another operating system. It is a living, evolving system designed to:

- Think autonomously
- Learn from usage patterns
- Optimize itself through artificial intelligence
- Rebuild and evolve its components as needed

This is an experiment at the intersection of **kernel engineering**, **embedded systems**, and **machine intelligence** — pushing the boundaries of what an operating system can become.

  <summary>🎯 Objectives</summary>

- Build a fully bootable, bare-metal operating system from scratch
- Integrate basic AI/ML models to inform system-level decisions
- Enable self-monitoring and self-optimization over time
- Keep the codebase portable across architectures (starting with ARM/RPi)

  This image illustrates the **"Self-Evolving, AI-Driven OS Lifecycle"** — a conceptual flow for how your SAGE OS can autonomously detect hardware, build itself, and evolve across platforms.

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **AI Detects Architecture and Hardware**

   * On boot or install, SAGE OS's embedded AI analyzes the CPU type, memory, buses, I/O interfaces, and connected devices.

2. **Generate Platform-Specific Kernel and Drivers**

   * Based on the detected architecture (ARM, x86, RISC-V, etc.), the AI compiles or adapts the kernel and drivers tailored to the platform.

3. **Build Disk Image or Container**

   * The AI assembles a bootable `.img`, `.iso`, or container that includes the new kernel, drivers, and shell environment.

4. **Boot Automatically**

   * The new OS version is booted directly, either on the device or inside a VM/emulator (like QEMU) for testing.

5. **Monitor Performance and Stability**

   * AI continuously checks system behavior: uptime, crashes, latency, driver responses, etc.

6. **Stable → Keep New Image**

   * If everything runs well, the system promotes this version as the active build.

7. **Unstable → Roll Back**

   * If issues are found, the AI automatically rolls back to the previous known-good state.

This workflow allows **SAGE OS to evolve, rebuild, and test itself across any platform** — moving toward true autonomy and architectural universality.
