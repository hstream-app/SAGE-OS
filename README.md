- Rebuild and evolve its components as needed

This is an experiment at the intersection of **kernel engineering**, **embedded systems**, and **machine intelligence** — pushing the boundaries of what an operating system can become.

## 🚀 Features

- **Custom Bootloader**: Designed specifically for Raspberry Pi hardware
- **Bare-Metal Kernel**: Written in C and ARM assembly for maximum performance
- **AI Subsystem**: Integrated AI capabilities with the AI HAT+ accelerator
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory allocation and management
- **Shell Interface**: Interactive command-line interface
- **Hardware Abstraction**: Support for Raspberry Pi 3, 4, and 5
- **Device Drivers**: UART, GPIO, I2C, SPI, and AI HAT+ drivers
- **Multi-Architecture Support**: x86_64, aarch64, riscv64, arm

## 🧠 AI & Machine Learning Integration

SAGE OS includes embedded, resource-efficient AI components that can:
- Perform local inference using the AI HAT+ with up to 26 TOPS
- Support multiple model formats and precisions (FP32, FP16, INT8, INT4)
- Observe usage and optimize scheduling
- Trigger self-diagnostics and reconfiguration
- Dynamically adjust power consumption based on workload
- Monitor system health and performance
- Eventually, enable modular regeneration of subsystems

The AI HAT+ provides hardware acceleration for neural networks with:
- Up to 26 TOPS of neural processing power
- 4GB of dedicated memory for AI models
- Support for various model types (classification, detection, segmentation, generation)
- Power-efficient operation with multiple power modes
- Temperature monitoring and thermal management
- High-speed data transfer using SPI and control via I2C

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: ARM Assembly, C (kernel), Rust (core components), Python (tools & ML prototyping)
- **Platform**: Raspberry Pi 4B/5 (64-bit ARMv8/ARMv9)
- **Toolchain**: `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`, `rustc`, `QEMU`, `CMake`, TinyML (TFLM, uTensor)
- **Build Environment**: Cross-compilation (Linux, macOS)
- **AI Acceleration**: AI HAT+ with up to 26 TOPS neural processing

## 🚀 Getting Started

<details>
  <summary>🚀 Building and Running SAGE OS</summary>

### Prerequisites

To build and run SAGE OS, you need the following tools:

- Raspberry Pi 3, 4, or 5
- SD card
- USB-to-TTL serial cable
- Cross-compilation toolchain (aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc)
- Rust toolchain (for core components)
- Optional: AI HAT+ for neural processing acceleration

- GCC cross-compilers for your target architectures:
  - `x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc` for x86_64
  - `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` for ARM64/AArch64
  - `riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc` for RISC-V 64-bit

- QEMU for emulation:
  - `qemu-system-x86_64` for x86_64
  - `qemu-system-aarch64` for ARM64/AArch64
  - `qemu-system-riscv64` for RISC-V 64-bit

### Installing Prerequisites

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```bash
# Install cross-compilers
sudo apt-get install gcc-x86-64-linux-gnu gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu gcc-riscv64-linux-gnu

# Install QEMU
sudo apt-get install qemu-system-x86 qemu-system-arm qemu-system-misc

# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add aarch64-unknown-none
```

### Building SAGE OS

To build SAGE OS for a specific architecture:

```bash
# Clean previous build artifacts
make clean

# Build for x86_64
make ARCH=x86_64

# Build for ARM64/AArch64 (default)
make ARCH=aarch64

# Build for RISC-V 64-bit
make ARCH=riscv64

# Build for Raspberry Pi 4
make

# Build for Raspberry Pi 5
make rpi5

# Build for Raspberry Pi 5 with AI HAT+ support
make rpi5_ai
```

The build process creates:
- Object files for each source file
- `kernel.elf` - The linked ELF executable
- `kernel8.img` - The raw binary image

### Running SAGE OS

#### Using QEMU

You can run SAGE OS in QEMU using the provided script:

```bash
# Run on x86_64
./scripts/test_emulated.sh x86_64

# Run on ARM64/AArch64
./scripts/test_emulated.sh aarch64

# Run on RISC-V 64-bit
./scripts/test_emulated.sh riscv64

# For Raspberry Pi 3/4
./run_qemu.sh

# For Raspberry Pi 5
./run_qemu.sh -p rpi5
```

#### Running on Real Hardware

For Raspberry Pi (ARM64):
1. Copy `kernel8.img` and the appropriate config file to an SD card:
   - For Raspberry Pi 3/4: Use `config.txt`
   - For Raspberry Pi 5: Use `config_rpi5.txt` (rename to `config.txt` on the SD card)
2. Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi
3. Connect a serial console
4. Power on the Raspberry Pi

### Development

#### Adding New Features

1. Add your source files to the appropriate directory
2. Update the Makefile if necessary
3. Build and test using the commands above

#### License Compliance

All source files must include the BSD 3-Clause License header. You can check for compliance using:

```bash
./license-checker.py
```

If you need to add license headers to new files:

```bash
./add_license_headers.py
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Build Errors

- **Missing compiler**: Make sure you have installed the appropriate cross-compiler for your target architecture
- **Linker errors**: Check that all required object files are being included in the link step

#### Runtime Errors

- **Kernel doesn't boot**: Verify that the boot code for your architecture is correctly implemented
- **QEMU crashes**: Make sure you're using the correct QEMU parameters for your architecture

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for detailed build instructions.

### Shell Commands

Once booted, SAGE OS provides a shell with the following commands:

- `help` - Display available commands
- `echo [text]` - Echo text to the console
- `clear` - Clear the screen
- `meminfo` - Display memory information
- `reboot` - Reboot the system
- `version` - Display OS version information
