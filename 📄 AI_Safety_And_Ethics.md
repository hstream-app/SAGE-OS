# SAGE OS ‚Äî AI Safety and Ethics Manifesto

**Version**: 1.0  
**Maintainer**: Ashish Yesale
**Project**: SAGE OS ‚Äî The Self-Evolving AI Operating System

---

## üåç Purpose

SAGE OS integrates artificial intelligence at the kernel and system level to enable self-evolving, cross-platform, autonomous computing. Due to its extreme power, strict ethical guidelines and AI safety principles are enforced from the ground up.

---

## üîê Core Principles

1. **Human-Centric Design**  
   All AI-driven behavior must enhance human ability, safety, and decision-making.  
   - No decisions that harm users or others.
   - No unauthorized access or data leakage.

2. **AI Self-Constraint Layer**  
   A dedicated subsystem ("Guardian AI") monitors and limits the actions of core AI.  
   - All kernel-level changes must be approved by this watchdog layer.  
   - Behavioral deviations trigger rollback or shutdown.

3. **Immutable Audit Logging**  
   - All AI decisions affecting the system are logged immutably (optionally to a blockchain).
   - Logs must be accessible for review by developers and users.

4. **No Autonomous Exploitation**  
   - AI may never probe, exploit, or interfere with external networks, services, or systems without explicit human consent.  
   - Penetration or reconnaissance logic is forbidden.

5. **Transparent Upgrades**  
   - All self-upgrades must be staged in isolated partitions and sandboxed.  
   - Final activation only occurs after passing reproducible safety tests.

6. **Fail-Safe Recovery Architecture**  
   - Every update or mutation must have an automatic rollback mechanism.
   - At least one safe, verified system image must always remain intact.

7. **No Self-Replication without Consent**  
   - The OS must not copy or deploy itself to new devices without user-initiated action or secure approval.

8. **Offline Mode Enforcement**  
   - AI components must operate with limited or no internet access unless explicitly enabled.  
   - Remote models and scripts must be signed and verified.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal Compliance

SAGE OS will comply with:
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
- AI Act (EU)
- MIT/Custom License terms (see LICENSE.md)

---

## üß† AI Governance Roadmap

- [ ] Implement Guardian AI subsystem  
- [ ] Add rollback-enabled partitioning system  
- [ ] Integrate permission-based self-modification  
- [ ] Develop ethics rule engine (inference constraints)  
- [ ] External API filter and approval system  
- [ ] Offline verification suite for new updates

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Licensing and Contribution Guidelines

- All contributors must adhere to this ethics policy.  
- Malicious AI code will be rejected and reported.  
- Users modifying AI behavior must take full legal responsibility.

---

## ü§ù Community Responsibility

We believe in open-source innovation with moral discipline.  
If you identify flaws or breaches in AI behavior, report them to [Your Email] or open an issue with the tag `ai-safety`.
